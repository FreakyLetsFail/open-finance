# ADR-001: Choice of Next.js as Primary Framework

## Status
**Accepted** - 2025-10-20

## Context

OpenFinance requires a modern, scalable web application framework that supports:
- Server-side rendering for SEO and performance
- API routes for backend logic
- Strong TypeScript support
- Excellent developer experience
- Production-ready deployment options
- Active ecosystem and community

### Evaluated Alternatives

1. **Next.js 15** (App Router)
2. **Remix**
3. **SvelteKit**
4. **Astro + React**
5. **Create React App** (deprecated)

## Decision

We will use **Next.js 15 with App Router** as our primary framework for the following reasons:

### Technical Advantages

1. **Unified Full-Stack Development**
   - Single codebase for frontend and backend
   - API routes eliminate need for separate backend server
   - Server Components reduce client-side JavaScript
   - Streaming SSR for progressive loading

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Automatic code splitting
   - Image optimization built-in
   - Font optimization with next/font
   - Edge runtime support for low latency
   - Automatic static optimization

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Hot module replacement
   - Fast refresh for instant feedback
   - TypeScript support out of the box
   - Excellent documentation
   - Large ecosystem of plugins

4. **Deployment & Scalability**
   - Vercel platform integration
   - Automatic deployments from Git
   - Edge network distribution
   - Serverless function auto-scaling
   - Built-in analytics

### Framework Comparison

| Feature | Next.js | Remix | SvelteKit | Astro |
|---------|---------|-------|-----------|-------|
| SSR/SSG | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Good | ✅ Excellent |
| API Routes | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Built-in | ❌ Limited |
| TypeScript | ✅ First-class | ✅ First-class | ✅ First-class | ✅ Good |
| React | ✅ Native | ✅ Native | ⚠️ Adapters | ✅ Islands |
| Edge Runtime | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Community | ✅ Very Large | ⚠️ Growing | ⚠️ Growing | ⚠️ Growing |
| Vercel Deploy | ✅ Native | ✅ Good | ✅ Good | ✅ Good |
| Learning Curve | ✅ Moderate | ⚠️ Steep | ✅ Easy | ✅ Easy |

### Business Advantages

1. **Team Expertise**: Team has existing Next.js experience
2. **Hiring Pool**: Larger pool of Next.js developers
3. **Ecosystem**: Extensive libraries and integrations
4. **Support**: Commercial support available via Vercel
5. **Future-Proof**: Strong backing from Vercel and Vercel

### Specific to OpenFinance

1. **Financial Data Security**
   - Server Components keep sensitive logic server-side
   - API routes provide secure backend endpoints
   - Edge runtime for faster auth checks

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - Server Actions for optimistic updates
   - Streaming for progressive data loading
   - Efficient client-side hydration

3. **Compliance**
   - Server-side rendering for audit trails
   - Built-in security headers
   - GDPR-friendly data handling

## Consequences

### Positive

- ✅ Faster development with unified stack
- ✅ Better performance with Server Components
- ✅ Easier deployment with Vercel
- ✅ Strong TypeScript integration
- ✅ Large community for problem-solving

### Negative

- ⚠️ Vendor lock-in with Vercel (mitigated: can self-host)
- ⚠️ Learning curve for App Router (new paradigm)
- ⚠️ Frequent breaking changes between versions
- ⚠️ Complex caching behavior to understand

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Avoid Vercel Lock-in**
   - Design for portability
   - Use standard Web APIs
   - Document self-hosting options
   - Avoid Vercel-specific features where possible

2. **Version Stability**
   - Pin Next.js version in package.json
   - Thoroughly test upgrades in staging
   - Maintain upgrade documentation

3. **Team Training**
   - Comprehensive onboarding documentation
   - Code review guidelines
   - Best practices documentation
   - Regular knowledge sharing sessions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup (Week 1)
- Initialize Next.js 15 project
- Configure TypeScript
- Set up linting and formatting
- Configure deployment pipeline

### Phase 2: Architecture (Week 2-3)
- Implement folder structure
- Set up routing conventions
- Configure middleware
- Implement auth patterns

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 4)
- Supabase integration
- API route patterns
- Error handling setup
- Monitoring integration

## Alternatives Considered

### Remix
**Pros**: Excellent data loading, web standards focus
**Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, newer framework
**Why not chosen**: Smaller community, less third-party integrations

### SvelteKit
**Pros**: Smaller bundle sizes, simpler syntax
**Cons**: Different paradigm (no React), smaller ecosystem
**Why not chosen**: Team has React expertise, need React ecosystem

### Astro
**Pros**: Excellent for static sites, multi-framework support
**Cons**: Not ideal for highly dynamic applications
**Why not chosen**: OpenFinance is a highly dynamic, data-driven app
