## Prioritization Framework

This document uses the **RICE scoring framework** combined with **MoSCoW method** to prioritize features for OpenFinance MVP and future releases.

### RICE Framework
- **R**each: How many users will this feature impact? (1-10 scale)
- **I**mpact: How much will this feature impact each user? (0.25 = minimal, 0.5 = low, 1 = medium, 2 = high, 3 = massive)
- **C**onfidence: How confident are we in our estimates? (50% = low, 80% = medium, 100% = high)
- **E**ffort: How many person-weeks will this take? (estimate in weeks)

**RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

### MoSCoW Method
- **Must Have**: Critical for MVP launch
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
- **Could Have**: Nice to have if time permits
- **Won't Have**: Out of scope for current release
